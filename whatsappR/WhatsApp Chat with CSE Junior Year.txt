1/25/17, 2:40 PM - Nilesh: For guys in wsn, even lohini isn't able to access ieee papers, so manage it yourself. There are some open ieee papers available as well. Or we are free to use other paper apart from acm and ieee but we need to show those to her before start writing. There is no point to go to her with ieee paper now 🙊

1/25/17, 2:42 PM - Aviral: Yeah
1/25/17, 2:42 PM - Aviral: Most probably it won't
1/25/17, 2:43 PM - Nilesh: Ya the class is there and all i get about graded lab was her deadly smily 😁

1/25/17, 6:29 PM - Sridhar: If people planning mass bunks are not interested enough to attend the class, I feel it shouldn't be a problem for them to lose a couple of attendances.
1/25/17, 6:29 PM - Sridhar: Cut the BS please

1/25/17, 6:31 PM - ‪+91 80109 83319‬: There is no mass bunk if there isn't unanimity. All you can achieve is an unusually high number of absentees. Best of luck

1/25/17, 6:32 PM - Abhinav: Exactly
1/25/17, 6:32 PM - ‪+91 97111 50572‬: If everyone unites then no one loses the attendance or the lecture😅
1/25/17, 6:33 PM - Pranjal: Dude! Please forget the idea of Mass bunk

1/25/17, 6:33 PM - ‪+91 84471 03582‬: They lose their time. Far more important than ours.
Saturday isn't a holiday for them.

1/25/17, 6:35 PM - Nishank Saini: Everybody's arguments might be null and void anyway if the class gets cancelled xD
1/25/17, 6:35 PM - Radhika: Yup
1/25/17, 6:35 PM - Nishank Saini: There's a _slight_ chance of that happening... Right?!
1/25/17, 6:35 PM - Radhika: Yupp
1/25/17, 6:35 PM - ‪+91 97111 50572‬: Yup
1/25/17, 6:48 PM - Hari: Guys,
You can hate me for not being a team player, but please don't make this everyone's problem. If you wanna bunk, bunk. The rest of us have our own issues to handle and there are also people who cannot afford to risk loosing attendance for two more classes. And let's face it, Debo is not gonna waive attendance for two classes simply because nobody is attending.

2/8/17, 3:44 PM - Abhinav: Dpom probably won't vote and the hcl faculty comes from Gurgaon
2/8/17, 3:44 PM - ‪+91 95608 56704‬: As far as I know, they are not *required* to give a holiday on election day
2/8/17, 3:45 PM - Abhinav: This time Dpom will ask mitra to sit
2/8/17, 3:50 PM - ‪+91 95608 56704‬: Yeah sure
2/8/17, 3:52 PM - ‪+91 98100 03376‬: Mitra please acknowledge
2/8/17, 6:53 PM - Prerna: 😂
2/8/17, 6:58 PM - Siddharth Mitra: Vishal gets it.
2/8/17, 6:59 PM - ‪+91 95608 56704‬: ?!?
2/8/17, 6:59 PM - Samin: But in Delhi there's always a holiday on election
2/8/17, 6:59 PM - Samin: Day
2/8/17, 7:00 PM - Siddharth Mitra: Also, you guys do know it's not possible to get a holiday for that right?
2/8/17, 7:00 PM - ‪+91 95608 56704‬: Not sure if a private university is required to comply with such a holiday
2/8/17, 7:00 PM - ‪+91 95608 56704‬: What do you mean?
2/8/17, 7:00 PM - Samin: Yeah that may be the case
2/8/17, 7:00 PM - Nishank Saini: Anyway, it depends on the faculty
2/8/17, 7:00 PM - Siddharth Mitra: They don't. That's true.
2/8/17, 7:00 PM - Nishank Saini: The election is being done in phases
2/8/17, 7:01 PM - Abhinav: Mr. Nadar be like
 'mah university,
 mah rules'
2/8/17, 7:01 PM - Siddharth Mitra: But what I could do, is that I could make sure attendance is taken twice.
2/8/17, 7:01 PM - Siddharth Mitra: It was taken once last time.
2/8/17, 7:01 PM - Nishank Saini: There won't be any cancellation if the faculty does not have to vote on Saturday
2/8/17, 7:02 PM - Nishank Saini: ?
2/8/17, 7:02 PM - ‪+91 95608 56704‬: That's not the point
2/8/17, 7:05 PM - ‪+91 95608 56704‬: You mean once in both the sessions?
2/8/17, 7:06 PM - ‪+91 95608 56704‬: That would help people who would attend only one session of the two
2/8/17, 7:17 PM - Siddharth Mitra: Last week attendance was taken in the second half
2/8/17, 7:17 PM - Siddharth Mitra: So basically we attended the first half for no reason at all
2/8/17, 7:18 PM - ‪+91 95608 56704‬: Yeah that's also a correct point
2/8/17, 7:19 PM - Manasa: If you make sure it's taken only once instead, people won't have to attend both 😏
2/8/17, 7:24 PM - Rohit: Then no one will attend the first lecture
2/8/17, 7:34 PM - Pragya: 😂
2/8/17, 7:35 PM - ‪+91 95608 56704‬: And that will lead to the attendance being taken twice
2/8/17, 8:04 PM - Manu: Is anyone interested in working as a PHP developer

2/8/17, 9:25 PM - ‪+91 95608 56704‬: Not relevant
2/8/17, 9:25 PM - ‪+91 95608 56704‬: I just said that it's a possibility that they don't need to comply
2/8/17, 9:25 PM - ‪+91 95608 56704‬: Never said that I know it for sure

2/8/17, 11:04 PM - Siddharth Mitra: I tried arguing with the TA
2/8/17, 11:05 PM - Siddharth Mitra: He said it's so that we attend both
2/8/17, 11:05 PM - Siddharth Mitra: He could take the attendance in any one of the classes
2/8/17, 11:05 PM - Siddharth Mitra: Don't worry, I'll not let that happen
2/8/17, 11:05 PM - Deepankar: What man? Are u getting me wrong?? Why would u make him take attendance twice? In the second half it's perfectly okay XP
2/8/17, 11:07 PM - Siddharth Mitra: He can take it in either half.
2/8/17, 11:08 PM - Siddharth Mitra: But then again..
2/8/17, 11:08 PM - Deepankar: Taking in the 1st half isn't a wise choice. :p
